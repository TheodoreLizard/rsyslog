rsyslog
=======

This is where we contribute to [rsyslog](http://www.rsyslog.com/)

Documentation
-------------
All of the docs are in the doc/ directory. Contents from there get displayed on the rsyslog website [here](http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/)

RPM Packages
------------
If you want to contribute to those, take a look under the build/rhel/ directory. The [rsyslog maintainers](http://www.adiscon.com/en/) have [a repository](http://www.rsyslog.com/rhelcentos-rpms/) where you can get those RPMs.
